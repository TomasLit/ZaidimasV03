#ZaidimasV01

The game based on a party game where people sit in cirle, write a word answering some question on a list, fold it (so other people could not see whats written and then pass it to other player. In the end the paper is unfold and the sentense is read loudly. In many cases it's a very fun game. In the program the player answers 3 questions. Then computer generates random missing parts of the sentence and puts a final sentense with incorporated answers of the player.

#ZaidimasV02

Same basic ZaidimasV01, but with added history of previuos games.


Challanges: for some reason game sometimes crashed and sometimes worked just fine. It took me some time to find out that the reason for that was Lithuanian letters. And it wasn't easy to find a solution for the problem as it seems not many people are using Lithuanian letters so had to experiment with different codecs till found one which works.
